# Silhouette analysis can be used to study the separation distance between the
# resulting clusters.

# The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster
# is to points in the neighboring clusters and thus provides a way to assess
# parameters like number of clusters visually.

# This measure has a range of [-1, 1].

# Silhouette coefficients (as these values are referred to as) near +1 indicate
# that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters.
# A value of 0 indicates that the sample is on or very close to the decision
# boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicate that
# those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.
