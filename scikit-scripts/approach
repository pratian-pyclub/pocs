1. Choose a class of model by importing the appropriate estimator class from Scikit-Learn.
2. Choose model hyperparameters by instantiating this class with desired values.
3. Arrange data into a features matrix and target vector following the discussion above.
4. Fit the model to your data by calling the fit() method of the model instance.
5. Apply the Model to new data:
    - For supervised learning, often we predict labels for unknown data using the predict() method.
    - For unsupervised learning, we often transform or infer properties of the data using the transform() or predict() method.
